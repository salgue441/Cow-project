## üéØ Overview

This project implements an automated cow counting system using YOLOv8 object detection to monitor milking queue occupancy in dairy farms. The system captures images every 5 minutes, detects individual cows, and maintains detailed queue occupancy logs.

## ‚≠ê Highlights

- **Automated Monitoring**: captures queue images every 5 minutes.
- **Precise Detection**: 95% accuracy in cow counting using YOLOv8.
- **Production Ready**: containerized deployment with <3s processing time.
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS S3 for image storage
